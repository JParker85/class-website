      <h1>Policies</h1>
      <hr>

      <h2 id="absence-policy">Absence policy</h2>

      <p>You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your job placement guarantee is
      forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast.</p>

      <h2 id="late-homework-policy">Late homework policy</h2>

      <p>Your homework is due by 6 AM on the day it is due. After that, it is late. Like
      the absence policy, you can turn in homework late 4 times, although I do not
      recommend it.</p>

      <p>I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late.
      Solid attempts are not considered late.</p>

      <h2 id="honor-code">Honor code</h2>

      <p>You are expected to do your own work. You should use all resources available to
      you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is
      prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger
      project.</p>

      <p>Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting job
      placement.</p>

      <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

      <p>Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of
      a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.</p>

      <p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
      issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
      people to adhere to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules
      apply equally to teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.</p>

      <p>This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in
      the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
      us, the technical communities in which we participate.</p>

      <p>This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class,
      HipChat, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts, etc.</p>

      <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
      it by talking to your teacher. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your
      teacher, speak with any Iron Yard teacher or campus director.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your
      colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
      decisions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
      no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
      frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
      personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel
      uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Iron Yard
      community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with
      people outside the Iron Yard community.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> Be kind to others. Do not insult
      or put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
      sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this class.
      This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
            <li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
            <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
            <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
            <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
            <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Repeated harassment of others.
      In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>When we disagree, we try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social
      and technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is
      important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
      Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its
      varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have
      different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds
      a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to
      err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help
      resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.</p>
